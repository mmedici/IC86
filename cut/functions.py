def make_event_cuts(frame, event_cuts):
    """
    Cut out the frames that do not pass the event cuts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_cuts : dict[str] -> tuple
        Contains the event cuts. The keys are the names of the objects within
        the frame, and the values are tuples containing the information on the
        cut to make. For example, event_cuts['NDirDoms'] = (operator.gt, 5)
        means we only keep frames with an 'NDirDoms' that is greater than 5. Easy.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Indicates if the frame passed all the event cuts.

    Cut out the data for the DOMs that do not pass the dom cuts, then resave
    the data that did pass into the frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dom_cuts : dict[str] -> tuple
        Contains the information about the dom cuts. The layout of this
        dictionary is the same as event_cuts. Ie.
        dom_cuts['DistAboveEndpoint'] = (operator.gt, 100)

        than 100.

    -------------
    NameOfDOMKeyCut : I3VectorDouble
        The cut DOM data. This is done for all the keys in dom_keys.
